Welcome to EDO SYNTH, an interactive microtonal synthesiser which lets you create your own tuning systems and sounds. Here's a quick overview of how it works.

These two sliders determine the pitches of the synth. <<F0>> is where the scale starts and <<divisions>> changes how much the octave is divided into equal parts, hence equal divisions of the octave - EDO.

This drop down menu lets you choose an <<oscillator>>, or waveform. It determines the fundamental timbre of the synthesiser.

These 8 sliders are the audio effects. They each have a definition when you hover over them. You can click and drag the sliders or you can also MIDI map them to a device. Just click the <<map>> button then move the knob or slider on your device you wish to be mapped. The MIDI mapping is remembered when you return, you can also remap or clear it. Make sure your MIDI device is plugged in before you load the page.

You can use your computer keyboard to play the notes. The keypads highlighted are the available notes. For mobile users, the keypads can be tapped or held.

It is possible to record yourself playing and save it locally. Just click the <<record>> button to begin and <<stop>> to end the recording.
